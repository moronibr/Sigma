                The Sigma symbol Σ is a symbol used in math indicates summation,in chemistry it is used on chemical
                bonding,<br> so the sigma brings up the idea of always having more and more, more knowledge,
                more strenght, more wisdom, <br> more self control, more confidence, more virtue, more love, more power... <br>
                resuming, it calls up whoever looks at it to strive to better than yourself were yesterday <br>

            Jesus Christ <br>
            The Only Complete Realist <br>   <br>

              “No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good. 
              A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. 
              This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. 
              After all, you find out the strength of the German army by fighting against it, not by giving in. 
              You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. 
              A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. 
              That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness — they have lived a sheltered life by always giving in. 
              We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, 
              because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, 
              is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means — the only complete realist.”<br>

            Who Is It?<br>
            The Man In The Arena
            <br><br>
            It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
            or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
            whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, 
            because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, 
            the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
            and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid 
            souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
            <br>
            -Theodore Roosevelt
