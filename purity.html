                <p> We've already seen, many times when purity was used as an ofense, in movies, tv shows and even in the real life, 
                    people trying to weaken the belief in God of others by saying they are "Puritans", it's really funny to realize how devil knows 
                    how to turn good things in "bad thing'' how to make it look weird, but Purity is one of the results of Virtue,
                    Virtue brings us many things and purity is one of them, being pure doesn't mean you will not make mistakes because you will, 
                    we will, but puritiy is the line that separes those who are willing and humble to change and to turn into a better person
                    for himself, herself, and to his or her neighboors, being pure in other words, is accepting being refined by God's hands
