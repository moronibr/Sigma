        Normal paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>SIGMA</b><br>
        The Sigma symbol Σ is a symbol used in math indicates summation, and in chemistry it is used on chemical
        bonding, so the sigma brings up the idea of always having more and more, more knowledge,
        more strenght, more wisdom, more self control, more confidence, more virtue, more love, more power... 
        resuming, it calls up whoever looks ait it to strive to better than yourself were yesterday <br>
        
        <b>Mind Body and Spirit</b><br>
        The first register we have from bodybuilding comes from the old greek, many of the philosophers had 
        a constant improvement in the body, mind and in spirit, this practice got lost as the time passed by, 
        and in our days it was brought up by a man called Joe Weider, and the first champion was a man called 
        Larry Scott.<br>
        The time passed and the sport grew up, despite the growth the sport had it was always a target of
        prejudice from many people, and it is still considered a underground sport, what is not so bad since it
        filters those who have passion from those who don't.<br>
        But a certain moviment started to grown in our days, a moviment that says we have to accept our body size,
        shape and weight and that the society has builded a "pattern" where only bodies considered "fit" are 
        acceptable, and with this kind of thought many moviments and idea of "self acceptance" started coming up
        and started saying that 
        they were there to "desconstruct" the belief where only fit bodies are beautiful.<br>
        Although we know that this idea comes to be against the idea of building bodies, it tries to say to everyone
        they should accept themselves as they are, and to get conformed with their current appearence, yet this people
        use this approaching with the explicit objective of weaken the men, but why weaken the man is someone's goal? 
        the answer is feminism, an old and known moviment with the purpose of ending the differences between men and
        women in order to destroy the natural order of the family designed by God, end with the search for virtue,
        shred the innocence and destroy agency The President David O. McKay said "No wordly success can compensate
        for failure in home" it is really clear when we read this quote that the most important thing in our lives is our
        family, but the world and its moviments and collectives have their own idea of success, as I was saying before 
        this "self acceptance" that says it doesn't matter how our body looks like because we have to accept it without objection,
        and if you go against it you don't have empaty from those who can't live the same life style you do.
        And they are right in one thing, we have to accept ourselves, but acceptance has to come when we don't
        have the power of changing things, for example I'm short, and there is nothing I can do about it,
        but there are many things I can change and improve, Sócrates said "No man has the right to be an amateur
        in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength
        of which his body is capable."
