               <h5> "Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness.
                Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.'<br><br> " The Book of Mormon: Alma 41:10</h5>

                <p class="text"> For those who don't know, virtue is the same as strength, but many people think virtue is a word used by religions to make people 
                    fear God so they can be controlled, but actually, virtue is not about being controlled by someone else; virtue is 100% about 
                    self-control.
                    The world today tells us we have to do anything we want, anything that "makes us happy," but happiness is not in giving 
                    into temptation or to our natural desires; happiness is about self-control, for the one who cannot control himself or herself is 
                    fated to end with no control of his or her own fate.
